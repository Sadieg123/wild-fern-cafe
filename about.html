                        <h2>Our Story</h2>
                        <p>Wild Fern Café started with a simple idea: what if there was a coffee shop that felt less like a business and more like home? In 2019, founders Maya Chen and David Torres transformed a former bookshop on Maple Street into the cozy café you see today. They filled the space with plants, reclaimed furniture, and the warm aroma of fresh coffee, creating a welcoming environment where neighbors could connect over a great cup of joe. The name "Wild Fern" comes from Maya's grandmother's kitchen plant—a Boston fern that grew with wild abandon, symbolizing the natural growth and community they hoped to cultivate.</p>

                    <p>Step inside and you'll find more than just a café—you'll discover a space designed for connection and comfort. Sunlight streams through tall windows, illuminating rows of thriving plants and well-worn wooden tables that invite you to stay awhile. Our community table is always open for students, remote workers, or anyone who needs a productive space outside the house. We host monthly open mic nights, rotate artwork from local artists on our walls, and genuinely enjoy getting to know our regulars (though we love meeting new faces too!).</p>
                    <p>We believe coffee shops should be anchors in their neighborhoods—places where people bump into friends, where ideas are born over lattes, and where you can always count on a friendly face. That's the Wild Fern difference, and it's what keeps bringing people back day after day.</p>
